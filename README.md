# Bubble Sort algorithm simulator
This was an assignment given to me when I was in 1st year. This program demonstrates Bubble Sort algorithm. Java threads are used to
slow things down so people can observe how Bubble sort works.

PS : I didnt follow any best practices at the time I code this and it is kind of messy.
